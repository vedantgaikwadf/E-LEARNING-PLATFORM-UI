Project Description

The E-Learning Platform UI is a front-end web project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that simulates the user interface of an online learning system. The project focuses on creating a styled, interactive, and multi-page interface that allows users to browse courses, watch learning content, and track their progress.

The platform includes a course listing page where available courses are displayed in a card-based layout, making it easy for users to explore different learning options. Each course card provides a brief description and a navigation link to the course content page.

The course details page presents learning material in a structured format and includes embedded video content using an iframe to simulate real-world online learning experiences. Users can interact with the interface by marking lessons as completed, which enhances engagement and usability.

A dedicated progress tracking page visually represents course completion using an animated progress bar. Progress is stored and retrieved using browser local storage, allowing users to view their completion status even after navigating between pages. This approach demonstrates basic state persistence without requiring backend integration.

The user interface is styled with modern CSS techniques, including responsive layouts, shadows, hover effects, and smooth transitions, resulting in a clean and professional appearance. The multi-page navigation ensures a realistic platform structure similar to commercial e-learning systems.

Overall, this project showcases the ability to design user-centric front-end interfaces, implement basic interactivity, and structure a multi-page application. The E-Learning Platform UI effectively demonstrates frontend development skills and an understanding of educational platform design concepts.
